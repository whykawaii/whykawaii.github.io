    <h1 align="center">Hello World!</h1>
    <p>Hello, my username is <i>whykawaii</i>, an aspiring programmer with a passion for creating innovative solutions through code. My journey into the world of programming began in high school when I discovered the joy of building websites and simple applications. Since then, I’ve been captivated by the endless possibilities technology offers.</p>
    <p>I’m currently honing my skills in languages like <b>Python</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, and <b>HTML/CSS</b>. I love tackling new challenges, whether it’s developing a personal project or contributing to open-source initiatives. My goal is to merge creativity with technology, crafting user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems.</p>
    <p>When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring tech blogs, participating in hackathons, or diving into the latest programming tutorials. I believe in continuous learning and am always excited to expand my knowledge and connect with fellow developers.</p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting my site! Feel free to check out my projects or reach out if you’d like to collaborate or chat about tech.</p>
